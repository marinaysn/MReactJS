BOOTBOX

### npx create-react-app testProject

### cd testProject

Install the following packages (bootstrap and react-bootbox) to use react-bootbox to implement confirmation modal.

### npm i bootstrap react-bootbox --save

In the index.js file, import the bootstrap css

### import ‘bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css’;

Here we imported the Bootbox , which is shown on the screen on the basis on props show. The message as well as the action on the buttons can be changed from the props.

Run the app and see it its working fine.
